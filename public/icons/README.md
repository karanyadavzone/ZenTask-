# PWA Icons Setup

This directory needs the following icon files for the PWA to work properly:

## Required Icons:
- `favicon.ico` (16x16, 32x32, 48x48 sizes)
- `apple-touch-icon.png` (180x180)
- `icon-72x72.png`
- `icon-96x96.png`
- `icon-128x128.png`
- `icon-144x144.png`
- `icon-152x152.png`
- `icon-192x192.png`
- `icon-384x384.png`
- `icon-512x512.png`

## How to Generate Icons:

### Option 1: Use an Online Generator
1. Create a 512x512 PNG logo for your app
2. Use https://realfavicongenerator.net/ or https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator
3. Upload your logo and download all generated sizes

### Option 2: Use a Design Tool
1. Create your app icon in Figma, Sketch, or Photoshop
2. Export in all the required sizes listed above
3. Make sure icons are square and follow PWA guidelines

## Design Guidelines:
- Use the app's mint green color (#10b981) as primary
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Consider a rounded square or circle background
- Icon should work on both light and dark backgrounds

## Temporary Solution:
For now, you can create simple colored squares as placeholders:
1. Create a 512x512 PNG with mint green background
2. Add a simple "T" or task icon in white
3. Resize to all required dimensions
